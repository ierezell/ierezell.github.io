Originally developed by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur, Godot has grown into a vibrant community-driven project with contributions from developers worldwide.

## Key Features

### 1. **Node System**
Godot uses a unique scene system based on nodes. Each scene is a collection of nodes, which can be anything from graphical objects, physics bodies, sounds, or scripts. This modular approach allows for a highly flexible and organized development process.

### 2. **Scripting**
Godot supports multiple scripting languages, including its own GDScript, a Python-like language designed for ease of use and optimized for the engine. Additionally, Godot supports C#, C++, and visual scripting.

### 3. **Cross-Platform**
Godot allows developers to deploy their games to multiple platforms effortlessly. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, HTML5, and more, with a single codebase.

### 4. **2D and 3D Support**
Godot excels in both 2D and 3D game development. Its 2D engine is highly optimized, providing a wide range of tools for 2D games, while the 3D engine offers modern features like real-time global illumination, physics, and a fully scriptable render pipeline.

### 5. **Visual Editor**
The Godot editor is designed to be user-friendly and highly customizable. It includes a comprehensive set of tools for asset management, scene editing, animation, and debugging, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

### 6. **Animation System**
Godot's animation system is robust, supporting a variety of techniques including skeletal, blend-shape, and keyframe animations. The AnimationPlayer and AnimationTree nodes provide powerful ways to create and control complex animations.

## Advantages

### 1. **Open Source**
Being open-source, Godot allows developers to modify the engine to fit their needs and contribute to its development. This transparency fosters a strong, collaborative community.

### 2. **Cost-Effective**
Godot is free to use without any royalties or subscription fees, making it an attractive option for developers with limited budgets.

### 3. **Active Community**
The Godot community is active and supportive, offering extensive documentation, tutorials, and forums where developers can seek help and share their experiences.
